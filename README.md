# EC-311-Project

Here is where we are at: the file whack_a_mole has been tested with the file mole_tb, and passes the test bench. I tried writing the the contstraint file to run the file Debounced_WAM (in order to use the debouncer with the properly tested module), however this is still buggy/not working. So, in sum, the gameplay module works in software but is having trouble being implemented in hardware. 

Despite this, you should still be able to write and test your modules using the test bench code to see how it integrates. Ultimately, to get the module working on hardware I recomend someone just go to office hours and ask a TA for help.

Best of luck
